A simple, beginner-friendly Python script example that demonstrates how to scrape emails and domains from a webpage and save results to a CSV file.

## Safety

**Important:** Scraping websites without permission can violate terms of service and privacy laws (e.g. GDPR). **Do not** use this script to collect personal data from websites you do not own or have explicit permission to scrape. Use it on:
- your own sites
- official APIs
- or public sandbox sites designed for scraping practice (e.g. [ScrapePark.org](https://scrapepark.org), [scrapethissite.com](https://www.scrapethissite.com)).
